Script: Data Quality Validation â€“ Gold Layer
===============================================================================

Purpose:
    This script performs comprehensive data quality validations on the Gold layer 
    of the data warehouse to ensure the integrity, consistency, and accuracy 
    of analytical datasets.

    The validations include:
    - Ensuring uniqueness of surrogate keys in dimension tables.
    - Verifying referential integrity between fact and corresponding dimension tables.
    - Validating logical relationships across tables to support accurate reporting and insights.

Usage:
    - Execute this script after Gold layer views or tables are created and loaded.
    - Review and resolve any discrepancies or violations identified during the checks.
